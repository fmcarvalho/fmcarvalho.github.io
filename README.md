I started my professional career as a software analyst at SSF/Easysoft after 
concluding a 5 years degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (1992-97) at 
[IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/). Since then, I interleaved my path between the 
university and the industry.
I took [PAGE](https://www.clsbe.lisboa.ucp.pt/general-management-program/overview)
post-graduation (2000-01) at Catholic University of Portugal and I received the 
MsC (2003-05) and the PhD (2009-14) degrees in Computer and Software Engineering 
from [IST]( https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/). 
During this journey, I passed by Altitude Software, Quatro SI, [CCISEL]( http://www.cc.isel.ipl.pt/)
and [INESC ID]( https://www.inesc-id.pt/) where I had the opportunity to
participate in different kinds of information systems projects in direct
partnership with the industry. 
Since 2008, I am also an Assistant Professor at 
[Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.isel.pt/en/departamento/engenharia-electronica-e-telecomunicacoes-e-de-computadores)
of [ISEL](https://www.isel.pt/).

Passions? Family, development, sea, sports and traveling worldwide.
