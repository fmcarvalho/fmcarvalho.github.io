The stack Lenovo-Intel-Win10  is a completely rubbish for remote software developer work. Other guys with the same CPU and Windows 10 on different brand laptops have no breaks of performance as I am experiencing in my laptop.

Simply put, every time I am working with Zoom or Skype my CPU stays limited to 0.39GHz! After a while it returns to normality, as you can observe in next screen shots during and after a CPU break.
