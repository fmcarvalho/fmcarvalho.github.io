I am not a tourist guide, and I am not able to describe too much unless pointing the most iconic places I found in Norway. Nevertheless, one of the most surprising facts that I found in Norwegian habits was their similarities with countryside North Americans:  

* wooden houses without walls and surrounded by immaculate lawns.
* flag in the garden (BTW with the same colors).
* restricted sale of alcohol drinks.
* road speed limits.
* country music on the radio.
